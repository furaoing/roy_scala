NN Module Design Choice:

1. Each layer has an output vector only.
 Reason: The shape of the output vector is determined by the width of the layer.
 Each layer is independent, a behiend layer has no knowledge of the structure of the
 previous layer, therefore the input vector


2. The input of the layer and the input of each node on this layer are identical

3. Weigth is an attribute that belongs to each node, which refers to the conection between
this node and all the nodes of the previous layer

4. The external object method calls will be a wrapper function that requires no argument. The object method definition
will be written in purely object oriented style (access/modify object attribute)

5. The internal functions defined will start with a underscore (_), that will be written in purely
functional style (requires all necessary data to be passed in by function arguments)
